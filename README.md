# Data-Base
## Online Shop Database Project
This project is a fully developed database system for an online shop. It covers all stages, from initial ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram design to database generation and deployment.

Project Overview
## In this repository:

1.We design and create an ER diagram to structure the data model for the online shop.

2.We generate the database based on this ER design, ensuring it captures essential components like customers, orders, products, inventory, and transactions.

3.We implement the database using sqlite.
## ER Diagram
The ER diagram (see below) outlines the core entities, relationships, and attributes for this online shop database. It serves as the blueprint for building and maintaining a well-organized and efficient database structure.

## Project Phases
Design: Drafting the ER diagram and refining the structure based on relational database principles.

Database Generation: Translating the ER diagram into actual database tables, constraints, and relationships.

Deployment: Setting up and deploying the database for use in an online shop application.
